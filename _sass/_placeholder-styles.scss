// This is a placeholder Sass partial.
// In the full "Forty" theme, the _sass directory would contain many .scss files
// organized into subdirectories like libs, layout, components, etc.
// These files would define the actual styles for the theme.

// For example, you might have:
// _sass/layout/_header.scss
// _sass/components/_buttons.scss
// etc.

// These would then be imported into assets/sass/main.scss.

.placeholder-style {
    color: #BADA55; // A dummy style
}

// No front matter needed for Sass partials (files starting with _).
