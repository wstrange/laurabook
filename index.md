# Optional: If you want to feature some tiles on the homepage (e.g., chapters, about author, buy links)
# These would be configured in _config.yml and then individual markdown files created for each.
# For a very simple one-page site, you might not use tiles and just have content here or in the layout.

# Example of how tiles might be defined if you use them (content goes in separate files):
# tiles:
#   - title: About the Book
#     url: /about_book/ # Link to a page /about_book.md
#     image: assets/images/tile_image1.jpg
#   - title: About the Author
#     url: /about_author/
#     image: assets/images/tile_image2.jpg
#   - title: Where to Buy
#     url: /buy/
#     image: assets/images/tile_image3.jpg

<!-- 
This is the main landing page.
The "Forty" theme typically uses a layout called "home" which then pulls in content.
For a single book, much of the content might be directly in the layout or in includes.

You can add some introductory Markdown content here if your chosen layout supports it.
For example:

## Welcome to the official page for "Your Awesome Book Title"!

Discover a world of adventure, mystery, and unforgettable characters. 
[Learn More](#) (This could be a link to a section on the page or another page)

-->

<!-- Content for the main page will largely be driven by the 'home' layout from the Forty theme.
     The theme's `index.md` is often minimal, relying on the layout and `_config.yml`
     to populate the tiles and sections.

     For a single book promo, we might customize the `home` layout or create a new
     simpler layout that directly includes sections like:
     - Book Cover & Title
     - Synopsis
     - Author Bio
     - Purchase Links
     - Contact/Social Media
